  <md:title>Preface</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Precalculus is intended for college-level Precalculus students. Since Precalculus courses vary from one institution to the next, we have attempted to meet the needs of as broad an audience as possible, including all of the content that might be covered in any particular course. The result is a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text.   Many chapters of Openstax Precalculus are suitable for other freshman and sophomore math courses such as College Algebra and Trigonometry; however, instructors of those courses might need to supplement or adjust the material. Openstax will also be releasing a College Algebra and Trigonometry title tailored to the particular scope, sequence, and pedagogy of those courses.</md:abstract>

It is a comprehensive text that covers more ground than a typical one- or two-semester college-level precalculus course. The content is organized by clearly-defined learning objectives, and includes worked examples that demonstrate problem-solving approaches in an accessible way.
</para><section id="eip-250"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-id1164242457359"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus 2e</emphasis> contains twelve chapters, roughly divided into three groups. </para>

<item>Chapter 10: Analytic Geometry</item>
<item>Chapter 11: Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory</item>
<item>Chapter 12: Introduction to Calculus</item></list>
All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.</para></section><section id="eip-350"><title>Development Overview</title><para id="eip-377"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus 2e</emphasis> is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. </para><para id="eip-id1170058262242">The first eight chapters are built on the foundation of <emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions</emphasis> by David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen. Chapters 9-12 were written and developed from by our expert and highly experienced <link target-id="">author team</link>. All twelve chapters follow a new and innovative instructional design, and great care has been taken to maintain a consistent voice from cover to cover. New features have been introduced to flesh out the instruction, all of the graphics have been redone in a more contemporary style, and much of the content has been revised, replaced, or supplemented to bring the text more in line with mainstream approaches to teaching precalculus.
</para></section><section id="eip-42"><title>Accuracy of the Content</title><para id="eip-951">We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook an dedicated accuracy program led by experienced faculty. Examples, art, problems, and solutions were reviewed by dedicated faculty, with a separate team evaluating the answer key and solutions. </para>
<para id="para-00002">The text also benefits from years of usage by thousands of faculty and students. A core aspect of the second edition revision process included consolidating and ensuring consistency with regard to any errata and corrections that have been implemented during the series' extensive usage and incorporation into homework systems.</para></section>
<section id="sect-00002">
<title>Changes to the Second Edition</title>
<para id="para-00003">
The <emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus 2e</emphasis> revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy as well as inclusivity. Examples, Exercises, and Solutions were reviewed by multiple faculty experts. All improvement suggestions and errata updates, driven by faculty and students from several thousand colleges, were considered and unified across the different formats of the text.</para>
<para id="para-00004">
OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers.</para>

<para id="para-00005">The revision also focused on supporting inclusive and welcoming learning experiences. The introductory narratives, example and problem contexts, and even many of the names used for fictional people in the text were all reviewed using a diversity, equity, and inclusion framework. Several hundred resulting revisions improve the balance and relevance to the students using the text, while maintaining a variety of applications to diverse careers and academic fields. In particular, explanations of scientific and historical aspects of mathematics have been expanded to include more contributors. For example, the authors added additional historical and multicultural context regarding what is widely known as Pascal’s Triangle, and similarly added details regarding the international process of decoding the Enigma machine (including the role of Polish college students). Several chapter-opening narratives and in-chapter references are completely new, and contexts across all chapters were specifically reviewed for equity in gender representation and connotation.</para></section>

<section id="eip-563"><title>Pedagogical Foundations and Features</title><section id="eip-61"><title>Learning Objectives</title><para id="eip-86">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.</para></section><section id="eip-719"><title>Narrative Text</title><para id="eip-784">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
<list id="eip-id1166658637533"><item>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</item>
<item>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</item>
</list></para></section>
<section id="eip-802"><title>Examples</title><para id="eip-321">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All told, there are more than 650 Examples, or an average of about 55 per chapter. </para><para id="eip-id1166796259369">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we conclude with an Analysis reflecting on the broader implications of the Solution just shown.
</para></section><section id="eip-236"><title>Figures</title><para id="eip-829"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus 2e</emphasis> contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

Several elements, each marked by a distinctive icon, serve to support Examples.
</para>

<list id="eip-id1171887752668"><item>
A <emphasis effect="bold"> How To</emphasis> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   </item>

<item>
A <emphasis effect="bold">Try It</emphasis> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem.  In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</item>

<item>
A <emphasis effect="bold">Q&amp;A</emphasis> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  </item>

<item>
The <emphasis effect="bold">Media</emphasis> icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. </item></list><para id="eip-165">While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany <emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus 2e</emphasis>. </para></section><section id="eip-166"><title>Section Exercises</title><para id="eip-526">Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 5900 exercises across the 12 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose.</para>
