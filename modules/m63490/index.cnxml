<section id="eip-728"><title>Errata</title><para id="eip-886">
All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on openstax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.</para><section id="eip-990"><title>Format</title><para id="eip-109">

The modular approach and richness of content ensure that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. College Algebra offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in the material before asking students to apply what they’ve learned.</para></section><section id="eip-250"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-id1164242457359">In determining the concepts, skills, and topics to cover, we engaged dozens of highly experienced instructors with a range of student audiences.  The resulting scope and sequence proceeds logically while allowing for a significant amount of flexibility in instruction.  </para><para id="eip-id1164239746735">Chapters 1 and 2 provide both a review and foundation for study of functions that begins in Chapter 3.  The authors recognize that while some institutions may find this material a prerequisite, other institutions have told us that they have a cohort that need the prerequisite skills built into the course.

Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors.</para><para id="eip-id1170058262242">The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble.  The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and highlights, which help students overcome these barriers.  As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.  </para></section>
<section id="eip-42"><title>Accuracy of the Content</title>
<para id="eip-951">We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook an accuracy program led by experienced faculty. Examples, art, problems, and solutions were reviewed by dedicated faculty, with a separate team evaluating the answer key and solutions. </para>
<para id="para-00002">The text also benefits from years of usage by thousands of faculty and students. A core aspect of the second edition revision process included consolidating and ensuring consistency with regard to any errata and corrections that have been implemented during the series' extensive usage and incorporation into homework systems.</para></section>
<section id="sect-00002"><title>Changes to the Second Edition</title><para id="para-00003">The <emphasis effect="italics">College Algebra 2e</emphasis> revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy as well as inclusivity. Examples, Exercises, and Solutions were reviewed by multiple faculty experts. All improvement suggestions and errata updates, driven by faculty and students from several thousand colleges, were considered and unified across the different formats of the text.</para><para id="para-00004">

  OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers. </para><para id="para-00005">
  
  The revision also focused on supporting inclusive and welcoming learning experiences. The introductory narratives, example and problem contexts, and even many of the names used for fictional people in the text were all reviewed using a diversity, equity, and inclusion framework. Several hundred resulting revisions improve the balance and relevance to the students using the text, while maintaining a variety of applications to diverse careers and academic fields. In particular, explanations of scientific and historical aspects of mathematics have been expanded to include more contributors. For example, the authors added additional historical and multicultural context regarding what is widely known as Pascal’s Triangle, and similarly added details regarding the international process of decoding the Enigma machine (including the role of Polish college students). Several chapter-opening narratives and in-chapter references are completely new, and contexts across all chapters were specifically reviewed for equity in gender representation and connotation.</para><para id="para-00006">Finally, prior to the release of this edition, OpenStax published a version to support Corequisite instruction, which is described in more detail below.</para></section>
<section id="eip-563"><title>Pedagogical Foundations and Features</title><section id="eip-61"><title>Learning Objectives</title><para id="eip-86">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element
</para></section><section id="eip-719"><title>Narrative text</title><para id="eip-784">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
<list id="eip-id1166658637533"><item>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</item>
<item>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</item>
</list></para></section><section id="eip-802"><title>Examples</title><para id="eip-321">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. </para><para id="eip-id1166796259369">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve.  The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach — in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner.  Finally, the Analysis (for select examples)  reflects  on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a “Try It” question, as explained below. </para></section><section id="eip-236"><title>Figures</title><para id="eip-829"><emphasis effect="italics">College Algebra 2e</emphasis> contains many figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

</media></section><section id="eip-22"><title>Supporting Features</title><para id="eip-id7251558">Several elements, each marked by a distinctive icon, contribute to and check understanding.</para>
<list id="eip-id1167601990420" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>
A <emphasis>How To</emphasis> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   </item>

<item>A <emphasis>Try It</emphasis> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</item>

<item>A <emphasis>Q&amp;A</emphasis> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  </item>

<item>The <emphasis>Media</emphasis> icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. </item>
</list><para id="eip-473">While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany <emphasis effect="italics">College Algebra 2e</emphasis>. </para></section><section id="eip-166"><title>Section Exercises</title><para id="eip-526">Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 4600 exercises across the 9 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose.
</para><para id="eip-96">Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order:
<list id="eip-id8611023" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item><emphasis>Verbal</emphasis> questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.</item>
<item><emphasis>Algebraic</emphasis> problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.</item>
<item><emphasis>Graphical</emphasis> problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph.</item>
<item><emphasis>Numeric</emphasis> problems require the student to perform calculations or computations.</item>
<item><emphasis>Technology</emphasis> problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.</item>
<item><emphasis>Extensions</emphasis> pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.</item>
<item><emphasis>Real-World Applications</emphasis> present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.</item></list></para></section><section id="eip-82"><title>Chapter Review Features</title><para id="eip-33">Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams.

<item><emphasis>Answer Key</emphasis> includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.</item></list></para></section>
<section id="sect-00003"><title>Corequisite Support</title><para id="para-00007">Each <emphasis effect="italics">College Algebra 2e</emphasis> section is paired with a thoughtfully developed, topically aligned skills module that prepares students for the course material. Sharon North (St. Louis Community College) developed a coordinated set of support resources, which provide review, instruction, and practice for algebra students. The author team identified foundational skills and concepts, then mapped them to each module. The corequisite sections include conceptual overviews, worked examples, and guided practice; they incorporate relevant material from OpenStax’s Developmental Math series. They are available as separate, openly accessible downloads from the student and instructor resources pages accompanying the text. And they are also provided in an integrated manner in an alternate version of the text, <emphasis effect="italics">College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support</emphasis>.</para></section>
